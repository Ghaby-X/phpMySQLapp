# Disaster Recovery Learnings

This document outlines the disaster recovery implementation for the phpMySQLapp using AWS Copilot and multi-region deployment strategy.

## Overview

The disaster recovery setup implements a primary-secondary failover architecture across two AWS regions:

- **Primary Region**: eu-west-1 (Ireland)
- **Secondary Region**: eu-central-1 (Frankfurt)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Multi-Region Deployment with AWS Copilot

Used AWS Copilot to create and deploy the application across multiple regions:

```bash
# Create new environment in secondary region
copilot env init --name disaster-recovery
# Configure environment for eu-central-1 region
copilot env deploy --name disaster-recovery
# Deploy service to secondary region
copilot svc deploy --name <service-name> --env disaster-recovery
```

**Key Benefits:**

- Simplified multi-region deployment
- Consistent infrastructure across regions
- Automated ECS service provisioning with load balancers

### 2. DNS Failover Configuration

Implemented Route 53 health checks and failover routing:

1. **Created New Hosted Zone**: Set up DNS management for the domain
2. **Configured Failover Records**:
   - **Primary Record**: Points to eu-west-1 load balancer
   - **Secondary Record**: Points to eu-central-1 load balancer
   - **Health Checks**: Monitor primary endpoint availability

**Configuration Details:**

- Record Type: A record with alias to Application Load Balancer
- Routing Policy: Failover
- Health Check: HTTP/HTTPS endpoint monitoring
- TTL: Low value (60 seconds) for faster failover

### 3. Database Cross-Region Replication

Implemented RDS cross-region replication for data consistency:

**Setup Process:**

1. Created cross-region replica in eu-central-1 from primary RDS instance in eu-west-1
2. Configured automated backups on both instances
3. Set up monitoring for replication lag

**Benefits:**

- Near real-time data synchronization
- Ability to promote cross-region replica to standalone instance during failover
- Reduced data loss (RPO) in disaster scenarios

## Architecture Components

### Primary Region (eu-west-1)

- ECS Service with Application Load Balancer
- RDS MySQL Primary Instance
- Route 53 Primary Failover Record

### Secondary Region (eu-central-1)

- ECS Service with Application Load Balancer
- RDS MySQL Cross region Replica
- Route 53 Secondary Failover Record

## Key Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **AWS Copilot Simplicity**: Deploying to multiple regions was straightforward with Copilot's environment abstraction
2. **Automated Infrastructure**: Load balancers and ECS services were automatically configured
3. **DNS Failover**: Route 53 health checks provide reliable failover detection
4. **Database Replication**: RDS cross-region replication maintained data consistency

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensuring database connection strings were correctly configured for each region
2. **Health Check Tuning**: Required adjustment of health check intervals and failure thresholds
3. **Cost Considerations**: Running duplicate infrastructure increases operational costs

### Best Practices Identified

1. **Regular Testing**: Periodically test failover scenarios to ensure functionality
2. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring for both regions
3. **Documentation**: Maintain clear runbooks for disaster recovery procedures
4. **Automation**: Consider automating the failover process for faster recovery

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

- **RTO**: ~5-10 minutes (DNS propagation + health check intervals)
- **RPO**: ~5 minutes (RDS replication lag)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Planned Failover Tests**: Monthly testing of DNS failover functionality
2. **Database Promotion**: Test read replica promotion process
3. **Application Validation**: Verify application functionality in secondary region
4. **Rollback Procedures**: Test switching back to primary region

## Future Improvements

1. **Automated Failover**: Implement Lambda-based automated failover triggers
2. **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Consider multi-AZ deployments within each region
3. **Database Clustering**: Evaluate Aurora Global Database for improved replication
4. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Implement comprehensive observability across regions

## Cost Optimization

- Monitor resource utilization in secondary region
- Consider using smaller instance types for standby resources
- Implement automated scaling policies
- Regular review of cross-region data transfer costs
